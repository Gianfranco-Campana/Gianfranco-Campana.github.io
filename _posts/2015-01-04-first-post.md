Did you ever find yourself in a situation where you didn't take the market basket thinking: 
> ohhh... I've just two little things to buy...

and then after some minutes you are with your arms full of rickety products covering your sight threatening to fall on the floor all the time ... and missing some piece off and on all your eyes seek, moving from side to side, is a basket or cart where you drop them?

If the answer is yes, nice... you can understand what happens to me where some sparks of ideas, some achievements or discovers, some surprise or funny work, risk to be miss from any chance to be saved or shared, and would be beautiful to find a place where to "drop them" ;)

Yes, this websit is my market basket, so if you landed here and are curious to see what is in my mind and some -hopefully- useful work I can share, you are in the right place ! :)
