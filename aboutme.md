My name is Gianfranco Campana. I live in Italy, were I work for Megamark (at 2016) in many different projects data-and-business-related.

I enjoy my work and keep to follow a lifelong education, mostly but not only on online platforms (MIT-ProfessionalX, edX, Coursera, Googlelearn)

I also like to research, experiment and build something new by myself, often using some of the tools that I master, in unconventional way.

If you are reading this, you are already part of one of my target of 2016: to have a followed blog ;)

and so... thank you!!!
