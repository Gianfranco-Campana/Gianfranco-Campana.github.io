It was the Salento's sea.  
It was the Salento's sun.  

In Sectember 2014, me and my family were in a beatiful place in South Italy named "Torre Pali" on holiday:

It may be hard to believe, but there, one of my activities for a few days, had been to develop the well known [Kneser-Ney NLP algorithm in R/Shiny](https://gianfranco-campana.shinyapps.io/ShinyNLP/).

This example of predictive product was needed for the absolute first iteration of the Capstone Project and complete the JHU Data Science Specialization as "dry runner".

At that time I was thinking:  

> If you have to choose anyway, then choose the best... and Kneser-Ney is the State-of-the-Art algorithm for the text prediction job, so... 

... before/after the dips in water, some lines of code were daily dropped in my notebook... as you see below ;)
